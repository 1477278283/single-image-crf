Source code for "Camera Response Function Signature For Digital Forensics" (WIFS 2009)

To get started:

1) Download image and parameter data from http://1drv.ms/1OrdQ43
2) Unzip the folders to the main directory
2) Run wifs_main.m in Matlab

Note:

The Matlab code is unoptimized, therefore it tens of minutes to process an image.
